Next Steps
==========

So you have a bot up and running. Congratulations!
But where to now?

Further learning
----------------

Continue reading on in the next section for information about the various classes and functions that make up js-tale. 

These classes will provide you with all the functionality necessary to manage groups, send commands to servers, and subscribe to server events.


Other services
--------------

It is quite possible that you wish to hook your js-tale bot up with other services, such as a discord bot, or deploy it to a hosting service such as heroku.

Although this documentation does not cover other such services, the community in `A Township Tales Meta Discord <https://discord.gg/GNpmEN2>`_ may contain others with similar cross-service goals.

If there is particular interest in certain services, a new section to this documentation may be added with quick steps for preparing js-tale code to work well with them.
