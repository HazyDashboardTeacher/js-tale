Overview
========

This section will cover steps to get your bot up and running.

It is expected at this point that you have received a Client ID and Secret. If you have not, contact Joel_Alta with a desired bot name. You will be able to proceed with many of these steps, but will not be able to run the bot without a Client ID.

This will involve the following steps:

1) Installing global dependencies
2) Creating an empty js-tale typescript/nodejs project
3) Setting up a config file
4) Setting up index.ts with a basic bot template
5) Testing!

It is advised that you read through each of these steps thoroughly, to ensure you don't run into any issues.
