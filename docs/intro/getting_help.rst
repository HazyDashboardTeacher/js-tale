Getting Help
============

Throughout the process of creating and maintaining a client application, you may find yourself in need of assistance. It is recommended that you join the "bot" section of `A Township Tales Meta Discord <https://discord.gg/GNpmEN2>`_ (even if working on an SSO client).

Before asking for help, it is recommended that you make sure to have read through all relevent documentation, as any assistance provided will be with the presumption that you have both read the documentation, and have a basic understanding of Node.js. This is to help ensure discussion is productive, and that those with experience are not simply being asked to recite documentation 24/7.

If you feel that any part of the documentation is unclear, or could be improved, feel free to share your thoughts in the Discord.
